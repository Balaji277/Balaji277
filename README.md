Currently, at Innometric Hub, Iâ€™m developing real-time object detection models to power AR/VR navigation systems, using algorithms like YOLO and FCOS and deploying them through AWS. I have previously worked at Pyramid Inc, designing AI-driven logistics solutions by optimizing route planning and integrating models for real-time obstacle detection using Mask RCNN and Fast RCNN. My experience extends to end-to-end data pipelines, real-time processing, and improving operational efficiency.

During my internship at Biorobotics Lab, CMU, I also worked on an automated vision-based e-waste recycling project, building data pipelines and deploying object detection models using AWS and Kafka.

You can explore my projects, where I apply deep learning, data science, and cloud technologies to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions. Letâ€™s build something amazing!
